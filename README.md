SIRtest.py is a GUI file that allows you to check various results with graphs while modifying various parameters of the SIR standard model.

The tkinter, matplotlib, and numpy packages are required to run this file. numpy and matplotlib are installed by default with Python installed, so no other additional work is required, but tkinter must be installed separately.
The tkinter can be installed in the following ways.

Step 1: Check Python Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Open a Command Prompt or Terminal
Open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on macOS or Linux) on your computer. You can do this by searching for "Command Prompt" or "Terminal" in the search bar or by navigating to the appropriate application in your system's programs.

Step 3: Install tkinter
Enter the following command in the command prompt or terminal to install tkinter using the Python package manager pip:
  For Windows:

  $ pip install tk

  For macOS/Linux:

  $ pip3 install tk

Note: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the above command.

Step 4: Verify tkinter Installation
After the installation is complete, you can verify that tkinter is installed by opening a Python interactive shell or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Python, and then typing the following command:
  import tkinter
If you don't see any errors, then tkinter is successfully installed on your system.
